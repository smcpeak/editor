Manual tests of functionality


Specific tests
--------------

Do: Move the cursor beyond the end of the file and press Delete.
Check: Nothing should happen.

Do: Move the cursor beyond the end of the file and press Backspace.
Check: Nothing should happen.

Do: Select multiple whole lines of text.
Check: Selection box should be a clean rectangle containing those
lines, but not extending into the left margin.

Do: Open 11 files at once.
Check: The window menu should assign Alt+<digit> shortcuts to the
10 of the open files.

Do: Open test/allbytes.txt .
Check: See all the Latin-1 glyphs arranged in a 16x16 grid, including
hex quads for the nonprintable characters.


Test name: Multiple window simultaneous edit.

Do: Open the same file in two windows.  In the left window, put the
cursor on the line halfway through the file and press Ctrl+L to center
the display on that line.  In the other window, move the cursor a page
or so above the halfway point.  Now press Ctrl+K repeatedly (or hold it)
to delete lines including the one containing the cursor in the left
window.

Check: In the left window, the cursor's distance from the top of the
window should remain unchanged.  While lines above it are being deleted,
it should remain on the same line as identified by line contents; i.e.,
the line number should be decreasing.  The display should show the
updated file contents and cursor location after every deletion.

Do: Same as previous, but this time with a word selected in the left
window.

Check: Same basic behavior as before.  The same set of characters
should remain selected until they are deleted.


Areas to test (needs refinement into specific tests)

Load a file specifying its name on the command line.

Scrolling the buffer.

Resizing the window.
