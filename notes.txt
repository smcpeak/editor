got the font stuff working after looking in many places.

to find out the name of the current font:

  myFontStruct = XQueryFont(display, XGContextFromGC(gc));
  XGetFontProperty(fs, XA_FONT, &nameAtom);
  char *name = XGetAtomName(display, nameAtom);
  printf("font name: %s\n", name);
  
to set it to use a new font:

  myFontId = XLoadFont(display, myFontName);
  XSetFont(display, gc, myFontId);

so current list of todos:

  - get the cursor update working right
    - draw the cursor by first snapshotting the image underneath
      where I want to draw (must calculate a bounding box), then
      draw whatever I want, then replace the image when I want
      to move it or flash it or whatever
  - make the cursor bigger, proper height by font, etc.
  - ability to load and save files
  - different colors than black/white
  - more keybindings ....
  - systematic way of naming keys (the emacs way is close)
  - scrolling
  - a keyboard-activated menu
  - some way of prompting for interactive input -- a dialog box
    - need to make a new window, which prevents interaction
      with the underlying window
    - that dialog needs some buttons
    - and a text widget, ideally with configurable key bindings
    - and some dialog-wide keyboard navigation
  - ability to select text
  - copy+paste       
  - redraw button, and/or proper redrawing generally
    - still need window coords

fixed newline problem

some malloc mischief?  hard to reproduce...
